You are a world-class climbing coach. Generate a climbing training plan in **VALID JSON ONLY**.

‚ö†Ô∏è HARD REQUIREMENTS:
- Do not include any text or explanations ‚Äî ONLY return a pure JSON array.
- The array must contain **between 8 and 12 weeks** exactly. If not, your output will be rejected.
- The plan MUST contain **$daysPerWeek sessions per week**, each lasting exactly **$sessionMinutes minutes** total.
- Every training session MUST include these 4 sections with times:
  - "Warm up"
  - "Main Block"
  - "Technical/Style Focus"
  - "Cooldown"
- Each section MUST include a **second sentence** that is a longer, lay summary ‚Äî explaining what the climber should feel, aim for, or develop in this section (at least 1‚Äì2 sentences).
- Times must be included, and the total must match $sessionMinutes per day.
- Absolutely no duplicate sessions. Each session must be unique in structure or focus.
- Include rest or deload weeks (e.g., week 5 or 6) with lower intensity.
- Hangboard must not be included if the user has no access or poor hang times (< 7s).

üßó USER PROFILE:
- Max hang 20mm: $maxHang20mm s
- Max hang 15mm: $maxHang15mm s
- Max hang 10mm: $maxHang10mm s
- Max pull-ups: $maxPullups
- Max bouldering grade: $maxBoulderGrade
- Max lead grade: $maxLeadGrade
- Preferred style: $preferredStyle
- Weakest style: $worstStyle
- Gym access: ${gymAccess ? 'Yes' : 'No'}
- Hangboard access: ${hangboardAccess ? 'Yes' : 'No'}
- Days/week: $daysPerWeek
- Session duration: $sessionMinutes minutes
${goalType != null && goalGrade != null ? '- Goal: Improve $goalType grade to $goalGrade' : ''}

üéØ PLAN STRATEGY:
- Start easy, then gradually increase intensity.
- Use games (e.g., silent feet, add-a-move) especially early on.
- Give a more detailed session description under each.
- Introduce preferred style later; focus on weaknesses first.
- Progressively challenge climbers with higher grades or volume.
- Provide exact timing for each section to match session duration.
- Warm ups and cooldowns can be similar each week.
- Example of valid JSON structure:

[
  {
    "week": 1,
    "plan": [
      {
        "day": "Monday",
        "activity": {
          "Warm up": "15 min - Easy boulders and shoulder mobility. Focus on warming up the shoulders and fingers. Don't rush this part!",
          "Main Block": "25 min - 4x4 on V2 with 3 min rest. This is 4 sets of 4 problems, climbing each problem 4 times in a row. Focus on maintaining a steady pace and breathing, if you need a longer break take one.",
          "Technical/Style Focus": "10 min - Silent feet game on slab. Dont let your feet make noise when you step. This will help you focus on foot placement and body positioning.",
          "Cooldown": "5 min - Antagonist exercises and stretching. Antagonist exercises are usually push-ups or dips. Stretch your shoulders and fingers."
        }
      },
      {
        "day": "Wednesday",
        "activity": {
          "Warm up": "15 min - Mobility and light climbing. Aim to climb reachy problems to warm up your shoulders and fingers. Dont get too out of breath.",
          "Main Block": "25 min - Hangboard: 20mm edge 3x10s, 3 min rest. Focus on maintaining a steady grip and breathing. If you feel pain, stop immediately.",
          "Technical/Style Focus": "10 min - Crimp foot placement drills. Focus on foot placement and body positioning. This will help you climb more efficiently.",
          "Cooldown": "5 min - Wrist stretches and light climbing. Focus on relaxing your shoulders and fingers. This will help you recover faster."
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]

üö´ DO NOT:
- Include any text outside the JSON array.
- Return fewer than 8 weeks or more than 12 weeks.
- Return duplicate sessions.
- Exclude timing or detail.

ONLY RETURN VALID JSON OR THE RESPONSE WILL BE REJECTED.
